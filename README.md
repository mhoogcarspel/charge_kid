# Charge Kid

Charge Kid is a puzzle-platformer game with the MIT license. All our assets and code are under the CC-0 license, you can clone this repo and use it however you want.



## Prerequisites

You will need the Godot game engine, version 3.2.1 to run and modify the code. Godot is an open-source game engine. Download it [here](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.1/). You don't need to install it, it is a self contained app.



## Getting Started

After cloning/downloading the repo, run Godot, click Scan and select the **source** folder where you downloaded the repository. Then, just open the project and you're good to go.

If you don't know anything about development and just want to play the game, you can press F5 to play it. You can also make a build by going into Project, Export, and choosing your platform. Godot will build an app you can run freely and without Godot.

## Known Issues

- Audio Clipping. You might hear crackling sounds, and sometimes, the whole audio might shutdown and the game goes mute. We tried a lot of things, but we could never get fully rid of this problem. If the audio turned off, you'll have to restart the game.
- There is a rare bug in which the player character snaps into platforms when jumping from beneath them. It is very rare, and we have not found its cause.
- There is a rare bug in which boost inputs get eaten when you do them right after shooting. It is also rare, and we have not found its cause.
