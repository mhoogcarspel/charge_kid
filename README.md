# Charge Kid

Charge Kid is a puzzle-platformer game with the MIT license. All assets and code are under the CC(0 or BY-3.0) license, you can clone this repo and use it however you want.



## Prerequisites

You will need the Godot game engine, version 3.2.2 to run and modify the code. Godot is an open-source game engine. Download it [here](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.2/). You don't need to install it, it is a self contained app. For versions prior to 1.1.0, we used Godot 3.2.1 (download [here](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.1/)).



## Getting Started

After cloning/downloading the repo, run Godot, click Scan and select the *source* folder where you downloaded the repository. Then, just open the project and you're good to go.

If you don't know anything about development and just want to play the game, you can press F5 to play it. You can also make a build by going into Project, Export, and choosing your platform. Godot will build an app you can run freely and without Godot.

## Known Issues

- Audio shutting down. The audio might shut down in some very rare occasions. Prior to version 1.1.0, this bug was more common, now it is very rare. We do not know what causes it.
- There is a rare bug in which the player character snaps into platforms when jumping from beneath them. It is very rare, and we have not found its cause.
- There is a rare bug in which boost inputs get eaten when you do them right after shooting. It is also rare, and we have not found its cause.
